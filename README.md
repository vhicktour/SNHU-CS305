# ANSWERS
Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report
1. Client Overview:
Artemis Financial is a financial services company seeking to modernize their operations and enhance the security of their public web interface. Their primary concern is to protect client data and financial information during data transfer.

2. Software Requirements:
Artemis Financial required software security enhancements to ensure the protection of client data and financial information on their public web interface. This included implementing encryption, secure communication protocols, and checksum verification to safeguard against unauthorized access and tampering.

3. Thorough Analysis of Software Security Vulnerabilities:
During the vulnerability assessment, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Artemis Financial's software to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Through rigorous testing and examination, we were able to pinpoint vulnerabilities and effectively implement security measures to address them. It is crucial to code securely to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or leakage of sensitive data. Software security enhances trust with customers, protects the company's reputation, and mitigates financial and legal risks.

4. Challenging Aspects of Vulnerability Assessment:
One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was identifying complex vulnerabilities and understanding the implications of certain security weaknesses. However, helpful tools and methodologies such as OWASP Dependency-Check Maven and manual code reviews aided in the assessment process.

5. Enhancement of Security Layers:
To increase layers of security, we implemented encryption algorithms, deployed secure communication protocols such as HTTPS, and incorporated checksum verification for data integrity. Continuous monitoring and assessment of vulnerabilities using tools like penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability scanning were essential to prioritize and implement mitigation techniques effectively.

6. Testing for Functionality and Security:
We ensured the code and software application were both functional and secure through rigorous testing methodologies. This included unit testing, integration testing, and security testing to validate the functionality and security of the application. After refactoring the code, we conducted thorough testing to ensure that the changes didn't introduce new vulnerabilities. Automated testing tools and manual testing techniques were used for validation.

7. Resources and Tools Utilized:
Throughout the project, we utilized various resources, tools, and coding practices including IDEs like VSCode, security libraries, encryption algorithms such as SHA-256, and secure coding guidelines. These resources and practices can be applied to future assignments or tasks to enhance software security and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

8. Showcase for Future Employers:
The artifacts, reports, and documentation produced during this project serve as valuable assets to showcase our skills and experience in software security assessment and enhancement. These demonstrate our ability to analyze vulnerabilities, implement security measures effectively, and deliver secure software solutions, which are essential qualities sought after by future employers.
